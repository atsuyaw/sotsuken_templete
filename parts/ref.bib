abstract={Crystal-grain refinement is one of the effective approaches to obtaining high-strength materials. A good strength/ductility balance has been reported in fine grains of high- and medium-entropy alloys. However, crystal-grain refinement at the nanometer scale has not been achieved yet. In this study, we used electrodeposition to fabricate 0.2-mm thick equiatomic FeCoNi medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) with 10-nm crystal grains. The nanocrystalline FeCoNi MEAs exhibit the maximum tensile strength of 1.6Â GPa, which is the highest reported result to date.},
